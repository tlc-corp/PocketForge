# PocketForge Standalone ModPE server. 
## Things to note
- The console is bland and colorless
- World generation is dull
- Clients must be running BlockLauncher, MCPE Toolbox, or PocketForge-Patching App
- ModPE not yet implented
- PocketForge has no extra features such as the nether, new items, mob AI
- Player count is not implented yet
- If not on BlockLauncher, MCPE Toolbox, or PocketForge-Patching App, server appears offline.

# How to apply patches 
1. Make a directory called `patches` 
2. Add your patches 
3. Run compilePatches.sh until finished 
4. Run build.cmd and the server will auto-compile itself 

## INFO
Note: PocketForge is forked from PocketMine. It does not implent any extra features such as nether. It does, however support PocketMine plugins, as well as ModPE scripts. 
## When will this be done? All in good time. Just star / watch this and watch the magic!
